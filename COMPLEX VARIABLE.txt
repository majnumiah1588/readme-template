To find a complex function \( v(x, y) \) such that \( f(z) = u + iv \) is analytic, we need to find the conjugate harmonic function of \( u(x, y) \), where \( u(x, y) = e^{-x}(x\sin y - y\cos y) \).

The Cauchy-Riemann equations for a complex function \( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \) state:

\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \]
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \]

First, let's find the partial derivatives of \( u(x, y) \):

\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = -e^{-x}(x\sin y - y\cos y) + e^{-x}(\sin y) \]
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = e^{-x}(x\cos y + y\sin y) + e^{-x}(\cos y) \]

Comparing these with the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we get two equations:

1) \[ -e^{-x}(x\sin y - y\cos y) + e^{-x}(\sin y) = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \]
2) \[ e^{-x}(x\cos y + y\sin y) + e^{-x}(\cos y) = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \]

Now we need to solve these equations to find \( v(x, y) \). From equation (2), we can solve for \( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \):

\[ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = e^{-x}(x\cos y + y\sin y + \cos y) \]

Integrating this with respect to \( x \) gives us \( v(x, y) \):

\[ v(x, y) = \int (x\cos y + y\sin y + \cos y)e^{-x}dx \]

Integrating \( e^{-x} \) with respect to \( x \) gives \( -e^{-x} \), so the integral becomes:

\[ v(x, y) = -(x\cos y + y\sin y + \cos y)e^{-x} + g(y) \]

where \( g(y) \) is an arbitrary function of \( y \) that arises from integration with respect to \( x \). To determine \( g(y) \), we can use equation (1):

\[ \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -e^{-x}(x\sin y - y\cos y + \sin y) \]

Comparing this with \( \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -e^{-x}(x\sin y - y\cos y) + e^{-x}(\sin y) \), we find that \( g(y) = 0 \).

Therefore, the function \( v(x, y) \) that makes \( f(z) = u + iv \) analytic is:

\[ v(x, y) = -(x\cos y + y\sin y + \cos y)e^{-x} \]
